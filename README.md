# Car_sales_powerBi_dashboard_project
The objective of the Power BI dashboard should be to deliver a comprehensive, KPI‑driven sales performance analysis for the car business, enabling data‑driven decision‑making by:
1. Providing key sales overview metrics – YTD, MTD, and YOY total sales with growth rates and YTD vs. PTYD comparisons.
2. Tracking average price trends – YTD, MTD, and YOY average prices with growth and YTD vs. PTYD differences.
3. Monitoring cars‑sold metrics – YTD, MTD, and YOY units sold and the variance between YTD and PTYD volumes.
4. Visualising detailed YTD insights – weekly sales trend (line chart), sales distribution by body style (pie chart), sales split by colour (pie chart), and regional sales on a map.
The dashboard’s ultimate goal is to give stakeholders a concise, visual snapshot of sales performance, price dynamics and product preferences helping them identify trends and refine car‑sales strategies.
